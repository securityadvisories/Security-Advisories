===============================================================================
Title      : DLL Hijacking in OpenOrange Business Framework Allows Arbitrary
             Code Execution and Potential Privilege Escalation
Product    : OpenOrange Business Framework
Version    : 1.15.5
Platform   : Microsoft Windows
Severity   : Medium
Date       : 16/07/2024

===============================================================================

Overview
--------
A DLL hijacking vulnerability was identified in OpenOrange Business Framework
version 1.15.5. The issue stems from insecure installation directory
permissions combined with unsafe DLL loading behavior, allowing unprivileged
users to execute arbitrary code and potentially escalate privileges.

Affected Software
-----------------
Product:    OpenOrange Business Framework  
Version:    1.15.5  
Platform:   Microsoft Windows

Vulnerability Details
---------------------
The OpenOrange Business Framework is installed by default into:

    C:\OpenOrange

This directory is created with overly permissive access control, granting write
permissions to all authenticated users (NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users). This
was confirmed using the "icacls" command:

    NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(I)(OI)(CI)(M)

During execution, the main application executable ("OpenOrange.exe") searches
for required DLLs within its installation directory and loads them without
validating their origin or integrity.

This combination allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL in the
installation path. The DLL will be loaded automatically whenever the
application is run—by any user, including privileged accounts such as
Administrator—resulting in arbitrary code execution.

Execution by an unprivileged user enables arbitrary code execution and
persistence. Execution by a privileged user may result in local privilege
escalation and full system compromise.

Impact
------
A local unprivileged user can exploit this issue to:

    - Execute arbitrary code
    - Escalate privileges
    - Establish persistence on the system

Mitigation
----------
Administrators and vendors are advised to:

    - Restrict write access to the C:\OpenOrange directory
    - Avoid loading DLLs from user-writable paths
    - Use absolute paths or trusted directories for DLLs
    - Enforce code signing and integrity checks on loaded modules
